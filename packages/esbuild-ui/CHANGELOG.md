# @jimmydc/esbuild-ui

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 0189ef7: Export Text component and update VE Button to Stitches styling and properties

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 3629dc3: Add Box, Button, Spacer components to Stitches UI example. These are copied over from the Vanilla Extract UI example and converted. Most of this was a pretty easy transition as the APIs are quite similar between the two.
- c3637f6: Add Box and Text components with basic variant styling to showcase multi-variant combinations. This required adding the `recipes` package for Vanilla Extract, as I could not figure out a way to do multi-variants (e.g. Text with `weight` and `size` variants active at the same time) without the recipes package.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- a215159: Add storybook setup for Vanilla Extract and "type": "module" packages, which required some extra Webpack configuration.

### Minor Changes

- Add BigComponent which has all the code from lodash's `get` method built into it in order to test if larger components are properly code-split.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 86fc5ae: Add outline prop to Button. This allows for enabling a border around the button. The default is `false`
