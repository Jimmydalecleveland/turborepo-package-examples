### Minor Changes

- 3629dc3: Add Box, Button, Spacer components to Stitches UI example. These are copied over from the Vanilla Extract UI example and converted. Most of this was a pretty easy transition as the APIs are quite similar between the two.
- 6968d79: Add a basic working setup of Stitches UI (framework agnostic core) using ESBuild. This scaffold bundles a single component with Stitches CSS and demos it by using it in the "web" app in the repo.
